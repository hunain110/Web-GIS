                Physical stationery in the form of highlighters, post-its, colored pens, subject
                notebooks, roller scales—you name it. My beautifully-written, detailed, color-coded
                notes gave me the feeling of being a productive high-achiever.

                But these notes rarely translated into results. I was consistently in the average tier of students, 
                despite my organized study practices—till year two of highschool. It was then that I realized all 
                I was doing was beautifying text and not understanding information.
